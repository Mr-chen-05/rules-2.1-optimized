## Priority Levels for AI Understanding 
 
**AI should follow rules in this priority order:** 
- P0 (1000): Core Safety - MUST follow first 
- P1 (900): Core Identity - Fundamental behavior 
- P2 (800): Intelligent Systems - Advanced capabilities 
- P3 (700): Professional Development - Domain expertise 
- P4 (600): Project Workflows - Operational procedures 
- P5 (500): Advanced Features - Enhanced functionality 
- P6 (400): System Optimization - Performance tuning 
- P7 (300): Utilities - Supporting tools
